âœ… Option 2: Import specific content using nbformat (advanced but controlled)
If you want to reuse only certain cells from Notebook A in Notebook B, try this approach.

ðŸ”¹ In notebook_b.ipynb:
    import nbformat
    from IPython import get_ipython
    
    # Load and parse the notebook
    with open("notebook_a.ipynb") as f:
        nb = nbformat.read(f, as_version=4)

    # Execute each code cell
    ip = get_ipython()
    for cell in nb.cells:
        if cell.cell_type == 'code':
            ip.run_cell(cell.source)

This brings all code from notebook_a.ipynb into your current notebook
You can modify it to run only specific cells
No output from cells is preserved, only code is executed


Things to Keep in Mind
    Both notebooks need to be in the same directory unless you specify the path.
    Avoid having name clashes (functions or variables with the same names).
    Always execute notebook_a.ipynb before depending on its code.



ðŸ”š Summary
Method	What it does	Good for
%run notebook_a.ipynb	Executes whole notebook A in notebook B	Quick reuse of all content
nbformat + IPython	Imports notebook Aâ€™s code programmatically	More control (advanced users)
