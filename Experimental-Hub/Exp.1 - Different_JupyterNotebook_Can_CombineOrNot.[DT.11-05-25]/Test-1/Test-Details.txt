ðŸ”¸ 1. Convert the first notebook into a Python module
Best and cleanest way

Save reusable functions/classes from Notebook A (notebook_a.ipynb) into a .py file:
    # Inside notebook_a.ipynb
    def say_hello():
        print("Hello from notebook A!")


Export it:
In Jupyter: File â†’ Download as â†’ Python (.py)
Or manually copy and save as notebook_a_module.py


Then in your second notebook:
    from notebook_a_module import say_hello
    say_hello()
