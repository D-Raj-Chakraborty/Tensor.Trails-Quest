ðŸ”¸ 3. Use importnb (a third-party tool)
This allows you to import a Jupyter Notebook like a Python module.

Install it: (If not install)
    pip install importnb

Then in your second notebook:
    from importnb import Notebook
    
    with Notebook():
        import notebook_a  # assumes 'notebook_a.ipynb' exists
        notebook_a.say_hello()

Note:Slightly heavier, and used when you're working within many notebooks as modules.
